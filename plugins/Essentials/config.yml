# This is the config file for EssentialsX.
# This config was generated for version 2.21.2-dev+35-f4cd1c9.
# View the up-to-date default config at https://git.io/JG4z1

# If you want to use special characters in this document, such as accented letters, you MUST save the file as UTF-8, not ANSI.
# If you receive an error when Essentials loads, ensure that:
#  - No tabs are present: YAML only allows spaces
#  - Indents are correct: YAML hierarchy is based entirely on indentation
#  - You have "escaped" all apostrophes in your text: If you want to write "don't", for example, write "don''t" instead (note the doubled apostrophe)
#  - Text with symbols is enclosed in single or double quotation marks

# After editing the config, run '/essentials reload' in-game to apply the changes.
